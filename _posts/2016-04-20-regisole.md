REGISOLE

The following is an excerpt from a recorded interview between between artist David Spriggs and Jean-François Bélisle for Spriggs' solo exhibition PRISM at Arsenal Contemporary in Montreal, 2015\.

##### DS:

Regisole means Sun King. Regis is Latin for king, and Sol means the sun. Regisole was an ancient equestrian statue originally erected during the 4th century BC for a Roman Emperor in Ravenna, Italy. It was destroyed after the French Revolution by the Jacobin Club of Pavia since it was seen as a symbol of monarchy. It was, at the time, one of the most famous equestrian sculptures from the Roman Empire. It was gilded, which reflected the sunlight and how it got its nickname the Sun King. I was drawn to this relationship between light and state power. The positioning of the riot guard and the horse very accurately represents the description of the original Regisole. Over the years the Regisole sculpture has influenced a great number of other sculptures, including the equestrian statue of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius that still stands at the Campidoglio in Rome. I wanted to draw on history for my installation Regisole to bring together notions of power, colour and vision in order to create this contemporary symbol.

##### JFB:

And both of these works are, or were, as large as yours?

##### DS:

Accounts of the original Regisole differ when it comes to size, but, my representation is intended to dominate the  
viewer. It was important to me that viewers physically feel small when looking at the piece, like pawns looking up.

##### JFB:

How tall is the piece, anyway?

##### DS:

About 20 foot high.

##### JFB:

It really is dwarfing people. Standing next to it, we barely come up the horse's knee.

##### DS:

(laughs) That's true. I wanted something that, as the viewer walks into the room, they really react to. What's important with this piece, and with all my works, is that the viewer feels something. They are seduced by the strong aesthetics of the artwork and oppressed at the same time, just as people are easily seduced or oppressed by power. For me, this is a physical embodiment of power. Power has been quite a reoccurring theme in my work --- Axis of Power, the Paradox of Power. This is my most recent addition to the power series, which really represents a more contemporary version of power: in this case, state power. So, for me, while it does represent a riot guard on horseback, the method in which I've done it and the position of the horse and rider actually speak more about power than anything else. The work is more of a symbol than a representation of someone specific. A clear view of the riot guard's face always escapes the viewer regardless of their vantage point, touching on the notion of a faceless enforcer of power. Throughout history equestrian statues were constructed as a means to awe the viewer into submission and served as an iconological prototype for the demonstration of imperial power. Even today, horses are still being used as a symbol of power in the police as a means to intimidate people.

##### JFB:

And it works. Anyone who has been approached by a mounted police while you're just walking or standing knows it is quite uncomfortable.

##### DS:

I like the relationship, also, with art history. Art historically, the horse is a very powerful, and loaded, animal. Most of my works deal with symbols in one way or another. Obviously, different elements of surveillance and different technologies are used as a form of power, and this is another form of power. The horse is such a beautiful animal and holds such an important place in history. I like that I'm presenting a modern version of it. The way I've represented it is in a thermal image style. Thermal imaging is almost without vision. It actually uses heat variations to 'detect' body masses.

##### JFB:

So it's a form of perception that gives individuals the power to look where there is nothing for the naked eye to see.

##### DS:

This type of vision is very technological. The colours are actually arbitrary. When the technology was invented, scientists had to attribute a colour to each 'temperature' their tools perceived. I used the same colour code, so these really are the colours you might see in thermal images of a mounted horse. The spectrum goes from a deep red -- for the warmest parts -- to a dark blue -- for the coolest parts. So the guard's armour is a very dark blue and parts of the horse are red. I like how these colours instantaneously express power visually. It's much more powerful both aesthetically and conceptually than representing this subject in realistic colours. This is another artwork in the PRISM exhibition where colour is a conceptual device and draws on the idea of the separation of colour. The intensity of colours also makes the whole work really glow in the space. Foremost, it's an artwork. I want the viewer to have an emotional experience when they're in the space. The way the light plays internally with this work you also have the sense that this figure emanates light from within.

##### JFB:

Which goes back to the original Sun King sculpture, which reflected light and probably blinded the viewers on sunny days.

##### DS:

It's really a piece about light and seeing and therefore about the relationship between vision and power.

##### JFB:

Sure. Historically, sculptures of horses mounted by emperors or kings are erected to celebrate the amount of power that one has obtained during his lifetime. So, it's a bit like the end result of the surveillance and control apparatus.

##### DS:

I was thinking, "How can I represent the whole issue of power and surveillance today in one artistic form?" So for me, this piece is a symbol of this time period and what's happening right now.

##### JFB:

It's also a very concrete image of surveillance and control in a way, no? I feel like all the other pieces in the show represent apparatuses of surveillance but not of control. If you don't have an armed guard enforcing the power that comes with that surveillance, you don't really have control. Unless people self-govern themselves --- as we have with the Panopticon -- you need a law enforcer in the equation. This is a very clear expression of the type of control you can deploy if you have all the surveillance information.

##### DS:

And this form of power imposes a certain amount of obedience. I've been watching visitors look at this piece and I can feel a certain type of obedient reaction to this work. People usually stop talking when they approach it. It's a very strange thing, but it definitely does something to the viewer.

##### JFB:

Yes, a form of respect.

##### DS:

It's nice to be able to give some visibility to this concept and to these issues in this form. It's a piece that should resonate...
